    As we all know that the whole world is suffering from one of the deadly virus ever known to human history- Covid-19(also known as Corona) but the worst part is that many      
    people don’t know much about it, it’s symptoms , how to prevent or take precautions etc…
    So I decided to make a website to make people aware and also help them…
